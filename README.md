## Task 
Predicting numbers of bikes (in a bike sharing scheme) used on a day with machine learning.


Predictions are based on knowing factors for each day such as temperature, wind, precipitation, is it a holiday...etc and applying our trained machine learning model, based on these factors, to predict the number of bikes.

## Given
We were giving two years of previous data relating to the bike sharing scheme, to train and test our machine learning model.
Some of this data was purposely unclean, so we had to adjust this before training our model on it.

## Result
We are very proud of our resulting model, especially since we weren't as used to Python and Machine Learning, as other topics.

A lower score is better.


The top two teams got a score around 950.


Third place got a score of 1100.

We got a score of 1250.
